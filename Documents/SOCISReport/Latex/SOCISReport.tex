\noindent

ESA Summer of Code in Space (SOCIS) is a pilot program run 
by the Advanced Concepts Team of the European Space Agency 
that offers student developers stipends to write code for various 
space-related open source software projects. 
Through SOCIS, accepted student applicants are paired with a mentor 
or mentors from the participating projects, thus gaining exposure to 
real-world software development scenarios. In turn, the participating 
projects are able to more easily identify and bring in new developers.

InSAR framework has been choose.  

After almost 5 years of development, the \otb has become a
rich library used in many remote sensing context, from research work
to operational systems.  For more information on the \otb, please 
feel free to visit the \website.
